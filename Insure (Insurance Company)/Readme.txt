Online Insurance Service Web Application
Introduction

Insurance is a contract for payment of a sum of money to the person assured on the happening of the event insured against. Typically, the contract provides for payment of an amount on the date of maturity or at specified periodic intervals, or at unfortunate death if it occurs earlier. Insurance is universally acknowledged as an institution that eliminates risk by substituting certainty for uncertainty and comes to the timely aid of the family in the unfortunate event of death of the breadwinner.
